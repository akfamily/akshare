class Code(str):
    """BSON's JavaScript code type.

    Raises :class:`TypeError` if `code` is not an instance of
    :class:`basestring` (:class:`str` in python 3) or `scope`
    is not ``None`` or an instance of :class:`dict`.

    Scope variables can be set by passing a dictionary as the `scope`
    argument or by using keyword arguments. If a variable is set as a
    keyword argument it will override any setting for that variable in
    the `scope` dictionary.

    :Parameters:
      - `code`: A string containing JavaScript code to be evaluated or another
        instance of Code. In the latter case, the scope of `code` becomes this
        Code's :attr:`scope`.
      - `scope` (optional): dictionary representing the scope in which
        `code` should be evaluated - a mapping from identifiers (as
        strings) to values. Defaults to ``None``. This is applied after any
        scope associated with a given `code` above.
      - `**kwargs` (optional): scope variables can also be passed as
        keyword arguments. These are applied after `scope` and `code`.

    .. versionchanged:: 3.4
      The default value for :attr:`scope` is ``None`` instead of ``{}``.
