    The Oxford-Man Institute's "realised library" contains daily non-parametric measures of how volatility financial assets or indexes were in the past. Each day's volatility measure depends solely on financial data from that day. They are driven by the use of the latest innovations in econometric modelling and theory to design them, while we draw our high frequency data from the Thomson Reuters DataScope Tick History database. Realised measures are not volatility forecasts. However, some researchers use these measures as an input into forecasting models. The aim of this line of research is to make financial markets more transparent by exposing how volatility changes through time.

    This Library is used as the basis of some of our own research, which effects its scope, and is made available here to encourage the more widespread exploitation of these methods. It is given 'as is' and solely for informational purposes, please read the disclaimer.

    The volatility data can be visually explored. We make the complete up-to-date dataset available for download. Lists of assets covered and realized measures available are also available.

    Objective
    We provide up-to-date daily annualized realized volatilities for individual stocks, ETFs, and future contracts, which are estimated from high-frequency data. We are in the process of incorporating equities from global markets.

    Data
    We collect trades at their highest frequencies available (up to every millisecond for US equities after 2007), and clean them using the prevalent national best bid and offer (NBBO) that are available up to every second. The mid-quotes are calculated based on the NBBOs, so their highest sampling frequencies are also up to every second.

    Methodology
    We provide quasi-maximum likelihood estimates of volatility (QMLE) based on moving-average models MA(q), using non-zero returns of transaction prices (or mid-quotes if available) sampled up to their highest frequency available, for days with at least 12 observations. We select the best model (q) using Akaike Information Criterion (AIC). For comparison, we report realized volatility (RV) estimates using 5-minute and 15-minute subsampled returns.
